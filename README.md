# Nonvanishing a2 Coefficient

In the paper "Nonvanishing of the Second Coefficient of General Hecke Polynomials", we showed nonvanishing of the a2 coefficient for sufficiently large N,k.
This repository contains the code to compute the a2 coefficient in the finitely many remaining cases. 

It also contains code to verify certain theta bounds claimed in the paper.
